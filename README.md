# Learn Express

Express is a minimal framework for building web applications in Node. It would be helpful to read the [Express Introduction](https://github.com/oliverjam/express-intro) first. This workshop will introduce a few Express features that make building servers easier:

1. Routing
1. Route parameters
1. Middleware

## Setup

We'll be building a basic blogging app that lets you submit posts, view a list of all posts, view individual posts, and delete individual posts.

1. Clone this repo
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the auto-reloading server

If you open `workshop/server.js` you should see an Express server being created. It currently has no routes, so if you visit http://localhost:3000 you'll see a `404` page.

### Templates

All the HTML we need is already written in `workshop/templates.js`. We'll be focusing on creating route handlers to make our application work.

## Serving pages

Express makes it easy to handle requests for different URLs. We can add routes by calling functions on the server object. For example let's create a handler for the `GET /` route:

```js
server.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // handle request here
});
```

Express also provides a helper function for sending a response: [`res.send`](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.send). We can pass it a string and it will automatically set the `content-type` header to `text/html` for us. Since we have template functions already set up we can call one to get our HTML string:

```js
server.get("/", (req, res) => {
  const html = templates.home();
  res.send(html);
});
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 and you'll see a title and links to other pages (don't worry about the "Log in" link for now). These pages don't exist yet, so we'll have to add handlers for them.

Create a new route for `GET /new-post` that renders `templates.newPost`.

Then create another route for `GET /posts`. This should render `templates.allPosts`. Pass in the `posts` array so the template can render each post. There's currently just one hard-coded post, but we'll adding more soon.

```js
server.get("/new-post", (req, res) => {
  const html = templates.newPost();
  res.send(html);
});

server.get("/posts", (req, res) => {
  const html = templates.allPosts(posts);
  res.send(html);
});
```

</details>

If you visit http://localhost:3000/new-post you should see the form for creating new posts. If you visit http://localhost:3000/posts you should see the example post.

## Handling form submissions

Now that we are serving our `/new-post` page correctly we need a route that handles the form submission. Create a handler for the `POST /new-post` route:

```js
server.post("/new-post", (req, res) => {
  // handle submission here
});
```

Now we need to access the POST request body. In a vanilla Node server this would involve manually listening to the request stream and building up the body bit by bit. Luckily Express has something built-in to help.

### Middleware

Express middleware are handler functions that can be chained together. They transform the request in some way, then pass it on to the next handler. There are built-in middleware functions, 3rd party ones, and you can even write your own.

Express routes can actually take as many handler arguments as you like after the path argument:

```js
server.get("/", handlerOne, handlerTwo, handlerThree);
```

### Body parsing

Express has built-in middleware functions for parsing POST bodies. Since there are lots of common formats for POST request we need to pick the right one.

Our app uses an HTML form submission, which means the `content-type` will be `x-www-form-urlencoded` (e.g. a string like this: `name=oli&title=hello&content=rtest`).

All the built-in middleware are methods of the `express` object we imported. In this case we want [`express.urlencoded`](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#express.urlencoded). This is a function we have to call (and pass in any options) that _returns_ the middleware function:

```js
server.post("/new-post", express.urlencoded(), (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body);
});
```

The middleware will handle all the stream stuff, attach the parsed body to the request object, then defer to our handler. So we can use [`req.body`](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.body), which should be an object with all the values from the form.

Add this new handler, then submit the form at http://localhost:3000/new-post. You should see an object containing the values you submitted logged to your terminal.

Once you have the body parsed you need to "save" the new post. Since we don't want to mess with databases here just push the new post into the `posts` array at the top of the file.

```js
server.post("/new-post", express.urlencoded(), (req, res) => {
  const newPost = req.body;
  posts.push(newPost);
});
```

Finally, use [`res.redirect()`](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.redirect) to redirect to the `/posts` page.

```js
server.post("/new-post", express.urlencoded(), (req, res) => {
  const newPost = req.body;
  posts.push(newPost);
  res.redirect("/posts");
});
```

Now when you submit the form you should be redirected to a page showing your new post in the list.

## Route params

Each post in the list of posts links to a unique page. For example our test post links to `/posts/hello`. We can't create a static list of every possible route here, since we don't know the post titles ahead of time. Instead we can use ["route params"](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters), which allow us to use placeholder values in our route paths.

You can create a "param" in your path using a colon (`:`).

```js
server.get("/posts/:title", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.params.title);
});
```

Express will create a [`req.params`](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.params) object containing the param values. So if a user visits `/posts/hello` the above handler will log "hello". If a user visits `/posts/cupcake` it will log "cupcake".

We can use this dynamic value to find the post we want to show, then pass it in to `template.post`:

```js
server.get("/posts/:title", (req, res) => {
  const post = posts.find((p) => p.title === req.params.title);
  const html = templates.post(post);
  res.send(html);
});
```

Add this handler, then click each post in the list on `/posts`. You should see a new page for each containing the post content.

### Deleting posts

Each post in the list also has a delete anchor tag, which links to something like `/delete-post/hello`.

Add another handler for `GET /delete-post` that uses a route param to get the title of the post to delete. It should then remove that post from the `posts` array and redirect back to the `/posts` page.

**Note**: we are using the `GET` method here, not `DELETE`, because you can only send `DELETE` requests using client-side JS (with `fetch`). Using a link is simpler.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

You can use the [`array.filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) method to remove a post

</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```js
server.get("/delete-post/:title", (req, res) => {
  posts = posts.filter((p) => p.title !== req.params.title);
  res.redirect("/posts");
});
```

</details>

## Serving static assets

Our page doesn't look that great. We have some CSS in the `public` folder and linked in the `<head>` of each of our pages. However our server isn't serving these files (you can see the requests 404ing in the network tab).

In a vanilla Node server we'd have to manually read the file contents with `fs` and send them back to the browser.

Luckily Express has built-in middleware for this: [`express.static`](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#express.static). This is a function we call with the directory containing our static asset files. It returns the middleware function that serves the files.

```js
express.static("path/to/files");
```

Previously we added middleware to just a single route. However here we want this to run at the application level, since we don't know what URLs our assets might use. We can tell Express to run middleware for _every_ request with `server.use(handlerFn)`.

Add the static file handling middleware to your app. When you refresh the page you should see some styles take affect.

```js
server.use(express.static("workshop/public"));
```

## Cookies

Express makes working with cookies easier, as we don't have to manually write or parse the cookie headers. Let's add fake user authentication to our site.

**Note**: do not implement authentication like this on a real site. This is a very simplified example just so we can learn about how Express handles cookies.

### More body parsing

Create new routes for `GET /log-in` and `POST /log-in`. The `GET` route should render `templates.logIn` (which contains a login form that will submi to `POST /log-in`).

The `POST` route needs to parse the request body to get the user's submitted email. It should then redirect back to `/`.

We could add the `express.urlencoded` middleware to this route as well, but since we now need body parsing in two places it's easier to enable it for all routes. Use `server.use` to add the middleware to the entire app.

**Important**: Express runs handlers in the order you register them. Since our body parsing middleware needs to run _before_ any of our route handlers (otherwise they wouldn't have access to `req.body`) we need to register the middleware above all our other routes.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```js
server.use(express.urlencoded());

// other routes

server.get("/log-in", (req, res) => {
  const html = templates.logIn();
  res.send(html);
});

server.post("/log-in", (req, res) => {
  const email = req.body.email;
  console.log("email");
  res.redirect("/");
});
```

</details>

### Setting cookies

Our `POST` handler needs to set a cookie containing the submitted email. This is how we'll know if a user is logged in. Express provides the [`res.cookie`](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.cookie) method for this. The first argument is the name of the cookie, the second is the value and the third is an object containing any options (including `maxAge`).

Use `res.cookie` to set a cookie named "email" with the value of the submitted email, that expires in 600000ms (10 mins).

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```js
server.post("/log-in", (req, res) => {
  const email = req.body.email;
  res.cookie("email", email, { maxAge: 600000 });
  res.redirect("/");
});
```

</details>

You should now be able to see a cookie added in devtools after you submit the log in form.

### Reading cookies

Now we need to read the email cookie in our home handler. We can access the raw string containing all cookies on `req.headers.cookie`, but this isn't very easy to work with. It's a good idea to use the [`cookie-parser`](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-parser) middleware. This isn't built-in to Express, so we need to install it with npm.

```
npm i cookie-parser
```

Once installed you can `require` it, then add it to your app with `server.use` like the other middleware. This will automatically parse incoming cookie headers into a convenient object on [`req.cookies`](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.cookies).

Change the `GET /` handler to read the email cookie and pass it in to the template like this: `templates.home(email)`. The template will render a welcome message for the user if there's an email.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```js
const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");

server.use(cookieParser());

server.get("/", (req, res) => {
  const email = req.cookies.email;
  const html = templates.home(email);
  res.send(html);
});
```

</details>

You should now see a welcome message with your email once you submit the log in form.

### Removing cookies

Finally we need to allow users to log out and remove the cookie. Add a `GET /log-out` route. Express provides a [`res.clearCookie`](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.clearCookie) method that takes the name of the cookie you want to remove as an argument. Use this to remove the email cookie, then redirect to the homepage.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```js
server.get("/log-out", (req, res) => {
  res.clearCookie("email");
  res.redirect("/");
});
```

</details>

Now the log out link should clear your cookie and send you back to the "logged out" view of the homepage.

## Stretch goal

Currently users can create posts with any name. Use the email cookie to ensure that only logged in users can access the `GET /new-post` route. Remove the "name" input and instead use the user's email to set the post's author property.

Remember you can set a status code for your response like this: `res.status(401).send("<h1>nuh uh</h1>")`.
